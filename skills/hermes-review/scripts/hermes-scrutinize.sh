  --base REF   Review this branch against REF. Default: uncommitted changes if
               the tree is dirty, otherwise HEAD against the merge-base with
               the remote default branch.
  --model      Override the model Hermes reviews with.
  --profile    Hermes profile, which selects the model and the host it runs on.
               A hosted profile reviews with a model family unrelated to the
               local boxes, at the cost of sending the diff off the network.
  --extra      Text appended to the prompt: the change's intent and the product
               decisions behind it. Anything that narrows what to judge hides
               the defects outside it.
  --timeout    Seconds before the review is abandoned. Resolved per profile:
               the explicit value, then REVIEW_TIMEOUT_<PROFILE>, then
               HERMES_REVIEW_TIMEOUT, then 900.

Prints the path to the findings file on stdout.

Review a proposed code change in the repository at $ROOT.

Scope: $SCOPE
The complete diff is at $DIFF. Read it first, then read the surrounding source
files in the repository for the context needed to judge each change.

Apply ONLY Phases 2, 3 and 4 of the swe-reviewer skill: static analysis, the
severity taxonomy, and the findings write-up. Skip Phases 1 and 5 entirely.

Hard constraints:
- Do not create, checkout, or delete any git branch.
- Do not stage, commit, push, or run any git command that writes.
- Do not modify, create, or delete any file inside $ROOT.
- Judge the change, not the repository: a defect that predates it and that it
  does not make worse is out of scope. What the change leaves out is not —
  a member of a set it half-covers, a consumer it never updated, and a rule its
  own doc comment states and its code contradicts are all defects of the change.

Write your findings to $FINDINGS using the swe-reviewer entry format: severity,
exact file path and line number, the offending snippet, and a concrete
Recommendation. If a change is correct, say so rather than inventing a finding.

When the file is written, reply with one line: the count of findings per
severity class.
