"""Pin the lane-settled predicate's three-way answer, and pin the resume
prompt hermes-implement hands a timed-out session.

The predicate has three states and two inert ones, and the difference between
them is what a caller gating a tree relies on. The bug the issue opens with
was a lane amending over a person twelve seconds after the resume loop had
decided the lane was done. The same answer the predicate gives -- "settled",
"still running", or "drifted" -- has to distinguish a tree the lane never
touched from one it just left, and a tree it just left from one somebody else
has been editing since.

The second half drives bin/hermes-implement with a fake hermes that records
the prompts of each attempt. A timeout ends attempt 1 with HEAD still at BASE
and no marker on the branch saying so; the prompt itself must do that work --
and must say a new commit is required, restate the issue and --extra text, and
not include the false-on-timeout compile-claim that used to live there.

Run directly: `python3 tests/test_lane_settled.py`. No test runner -- stdlib
subprocess + a fresh git repo per scenario is enough.
