"""Pin remote-prune's reporting and its two fences against accidental deletion.

A bench dir is matched to its worktree by `tree_name`, because the worktree is
the only place `git cherry` can ask whether the branch landed. One with no
worktree behind it is left alone, as is the trunk and any name outside the
alphabet `tree_name` emits.

The fake ssh answers the idle threshold rather than calling `stat`, so the
decision is pinned without depending on the local clock.

The dry-run report is what an operator reads before `--prune`, so every label it
prints is pinned against the bench it was given.
