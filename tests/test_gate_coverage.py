"""Pin that every test suite in tests/ is reachable from gates.toml, and every
bin/ tool by a gate whose `when` cannot also match a tool that does not exist.

gate-verify reports the gates it selected, never the ones that do not exist, so
an unwired suite reads as a short run rather than a hole. An unwired bin/ tool
reads the same way when a broad `when` (a bare `bin/`, a `^bin/.*`, anything
that would also match a name under bin/ that nothing owns) wins the assertion
by accident: the check would report full coverage while running only the gate
that happened to match the broad pattern. The probe for that is mechanical: if
a gate's `when` also matches `bin/<a name that does not exist>`, it is matching
the directory, not this tool, and is not coverage for any specific one.

Checked both directions for suites: a suite no `when` selects, and a gate
whose `run` names a file that is gone.

The `self_tests` cases at the bottom exercise the probe against patterns the
issue names (bare `bin/`, blanket `^bin/.*`). They build a fake bin/ and a
fake gates list in a tmpdir so the tightened check can be run end-to-end
without rotating a gate in the real manifest.

Run directly: `python3 tests/test_gate_coverage.py`.
