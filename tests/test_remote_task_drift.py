The report is advisory end to end: a task without [task.mirrors] must print
nothing extra, a failing task-mirror-check must not fail the run, and a
machine without the tool on PATH must see a named skip rather than a shell
error. The ssh and rsync transport is faked with no-op scripts; the manifest
reader, the drift report, and the wiring in remote-task are the real thing,
so a regression in any of them is caught here, not just in the tool's own

    """The dead-caller waiter test holds on a slow prep ssh.

    The fix to RUN_LOCAL_FAKE_SSH narrowed its pidfile write to the build
    invocation, so the test's _wait_for_pidfile call cannot capture a
    short-lived prep ssh that has already exited. This test reproduces the
    bug deterministically by adding a 1s sleep to every non-build ssh
    call and then running the same dead-caller scenario. With the old
    "every ssh writes the pidfile" behaviour, the prep call's stale PID
    would arrive first and _wait_for_pidfile would return it; the test
    would then kill that already-dead PID, the real build ssh would
    never be killed, and the build would complete -- the very
    marker_present=True the reviewer found on CI.
